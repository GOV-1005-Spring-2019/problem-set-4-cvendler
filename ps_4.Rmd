## Question 1

```{r mad_libs}
# To fill in Mad Lib 1, create a new dataset called "mad_lib_1" in order to replace the "X" with the content of "mad_lib_1" dynamically using inline R code (here, the content is a singular number); begin with the "orig_data" dataset

mad_lib_2 <- orig_data %>% 
  # Filter the data to keep only observations for respondents who responded either "Rep" or "Und"
  filter(response %in% c("Rep", "Und")) %>% 
  # Count the observations by response (count the number of respondents who responded "Rep" and the number of respondents who responded "Und")
  count(response) %>% 
  # Spread the data using the variable "response" (the values of which are "Rep" and "Und") as the key and using the variable "n" (the values of which are the counts from above) as the value so that the dataset has two columns--one for "Rep" and one for "Und"--and one row, within which are the corresponding counts for "Rep" and "Und" responses
  spread(response, n) %>% 
  # Calculate the difference ("diff") between the count for Rep and the count for Und, reflecting how many more respondents there were who favored the Republican candidate than who were undecided
  summarize(diff = Rep - Und)
  
# To fill in Mad Lib 3, create a new dataset called "mad_lib_3" in order to replace the "X" with the content of "mad_lib_3" dynmically using inline R code (here, the content is a singular number); begin with the "orig_data" dataset

  filter(gender != gender_combined) %>% 
  # Count the number of observations in order to determine the number of individuals for whom the variables "gender" and "gender_combined" have different values
  count()

# To fill in Mad Lib 4, create a new dataset called "mad_lib_4" in order to replace the "X" with the content of "mad_lib_4" dynmically using inline R code (here, the content is a singular number); begin with the "orig_data" dataset
mad_lib_4 <- orig_data %>% 
  # Filter the data to keep only observations for respondents listed as "White" under "race_eth" but not listed as "White" under "file_race_black"
  filter(race_eth == "White", 
         file_race_black != "White") %>% 
  # Count the number of observations in order to determine the number of respondents listed as "White" under "race_eth" who are not listed as "White" under "file_race_black"

# To fill in Mad Lib %, create a new dataset called "mad_lib_5" in order to replace the "X" with the content of "mad_lib_5" dynmically using inline R code (here, the content is a singular number); begin with the "orig_data" dataset
mad_lib_5 <- orig_data %>% 
  # Filter the data to keep only observations for respondents who responded either "Dem" or "Rep"
  filter(response %in% c("Dem", "Rep")) %>% 
  # Group the data by the variable "response" in order to be able to compare first-response-timestamps across responses (here, "Dem" and "Rep")
  group_by(response) %>% 
  # Summarize the data in order to determine the timestamps of the first responses of "Dem" and "Rep" respectively ("first_response")
  summarize(first_response = min(timestamp)) %>% 
  # Spread the data using the varible "response" (the values of which are "Dem" and "Rep") as the key and using the variable "first_response" (the values of which are the timestamps of the first responses of "Dem" and "Rep" respectively) as the value so that the dataset has two columns--one for "Dem" and one for "Rep"--and one row, within which are the timestamp of the first "Dem" response and that of the first "Rep" response
  spread(response, first_response) %>% 
  # Calculate the time difference ("diff"), rounded to the nearest minute, between the timestamp of the first "Rep" response and that of the first "Dem" response in order to determine by how many minutes the first "Dem" response came before the first "Rep" response
  summarize(diff = round(Rep - Dem))
```

There were `r mad_lib_1` respondents who supported the Democratic candidate.

There were `r mad_lib_2` more respondents who favored the Republican candidate than who were Undecided.

There are two gender variables (`gender` and `gender_combined`). There are `r mad_lib_3` individuals for whom these variables have different values.

There are `r mad_lib_4` respondents listed as “White” under `race_eth` who are not listed as “White” under  `file_race_black`.

The first `response` of Dem came `r mad_lib_5` minutes (rounded to the nearest minute) before the first `response` of Rep.

## Question 3

```{r create_graphic, fig.width = 7.1}
# Set the width of the figure to 7.1 so that my subtitle does not get cut off when I knit this Rmd file (thank you to Jenny for this clever solution)

# Create a new dataset called "data_to_plot" to plot using ggplot; begin with the "orig_data" dataset
data_to_plot <- orig_data %>% 
  # Select only the variables pertinent to the plot, which are "educ" and "final_weight"

                                    "Graduate or Professional Degree")))

# Plot "data_to_plot"; set "educ" as the x-axis variable and "final_weight" as the y-axis variable; these assignments will later be flipped using the "coord_flip" function, but the ultimate goal is to be able to visualize the density of weights given to respondents of various levels of education and to be able to make comparisons across levels of education
ggplot(data_to_plot, aes(x = educ, y = final_weight)) + 
  # Make the plot a violin plot so that the above goal can be accomplished

  # Flip the coordinates so that x becomes y and y becomes x; visually, "final_weight" appears as the x-axis variable, and "educ" appears as the y-axis variable
  coord_flip() + 
  # Add "jittered" points to the plot (add random variation to the locations of points); set height (which, because of the flipping of coordinates, really affects width) and width (which, for the same reason, really affects height) values for the random noise so that the points match those on the plot provided in the problem set as closely as possible; set alpha to 0.5 so that the points are semi-transparent (so that individual points appear grey and not black)
  geom_jitter(height = 0.1, width = 0.2, alpha = 0.5) + 
  # Remove the x-axis label (which, visually, appears as the y-axis label, so I am removing the label for all the educational levels on the plot); give the y-axis (which, visually, appears as the x-axis) the label "Weight Given to Respondent in Calculating Poll Results"; give the plot a title, subtitle, and caption to match the plot provided in the problem set

## Question 4

```{r create_my_plot, fig.width = 7.6}

# Create a new dataset called "female_data" in order to manipulate only data for female respondents; begin with the "orig_data" dataset; I separate female and male data in this way because I encountered trouble when borrowing from the technique I used in Question 2 and, with help from my brief conversation with Albert after class, found that spreading the data, in this case, is not helpful

# Create a new dataset called "both" in order to combine the "female_data" and the "male_data" datasets into one dataset so as to be able to plot in one graphic both female and male data using ggplot; begin by binding together the rows of "female_data" and those of "male_data"
